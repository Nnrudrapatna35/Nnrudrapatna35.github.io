<h1>Hi, I'm Naga! Welcome to my blog.</h1>
<h2>I love chess.</h2>
<p>I recently discovered this <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com" target="_blank">website</a> describing chess variants and their fascinating histories. Check it out!
Let me share a chess variant I thought of recently. It's inspired by the latest developments in the chess world regarding cheating and computer engine use/misuse. The rules are very simple. Take regular (Western) chess and embrace the power of modern computer engines. Specifically, each player may request the evaluation once during a game. Only the bar is shown -- not the top engine move or corresponding line! You might ask: how does that help? Firstly, if the position is objectively winning for you with the correct sequence of moves, you normally might not even attempt to find it because you are careless in your assessment of the position. On the other hand, if the position appears to be losing for you, you normally might give up hope and concede. If you have retained your extra lifeline of computer assistance in this variant, you might be rewarded with the information that there indeed exists a resource you have yet to discover. This new rule rewards players once per game for their intuition and awareness (either of opportunity or danger). It is however very difficult to use effectively. Who knows when the optimal time is to rely on the lifeline? Inaccuracies, mistakes, and serious blunders can occur very unexpectedly and sometimes can be very hidden.</p>
