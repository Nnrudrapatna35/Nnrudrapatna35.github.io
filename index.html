<h1>Hello, welcome to my blog!</h1>
<h3>I love chess.</h3>
<p>I recently discovered this <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com" target="_blank">website</a> describing chess variants and their fascinating histories. Check it out!</p>

<p>Let me share a chess variant I thought of recently. It's inspired by the latest developments in the chess world regarding cheating and computer engine use/misuse.</p>
<p>The rules are very simple, don't worry. Start with classic (Western) chess and add in the power of modern computer engines. Specifically, each player may request the objective (true) board evaluation once during a game. Only the bar is shown â€” not the top engine move or corresponding line!</p>
<p>You might ask: how does that help? Firstly, if a position is objectively winning for you with the correct sequence of moves, you normally might not even attempt to find it because of carelessness or errors in your assessment of the position. On the other hand, if a position appears to be lost for you, you normally might give up hope and concede. But if you have retained your extra lifeline of computer assistance up to this point, you can be rewarded with the information that there indeed exists a resource you have yet to discover. This new rule rewards players once per game for their intuition and awareness (sensing opportunity or danger).</p>
<p>Of course, it is very difficult to use effectively. Who knows when the optimal time is to rely on the lifeline? Inaccuracies, mistakes, and serious blunders can occur very unexpectedly and sometimes can be very hidden.</p>
